I began my web development career in the 2016 and have fallen in love with flexibility and robustness of the platform. Since then, I've worked with a wide variety of organizations ranging from non-profits to government agencies building intuitive software for the web.

If i'm not on the computer, you can usually find me searching for the next best peruvian restaurant or hanging around with Sir Charles & Pickles, my two adorable cats üêà.
