I began my web development career in the 2016 and have fallen in 💓 with flexibility and robustness of the platform. Since then, I've worked with a wide variety of organizations ranging from non-profits to government agencies.

I create intuitive and inclusive web experiences by focusing on accessibility ♿ and meeting the latest WCAG 2.0 standards.

If i'm not on the computer, you can usually find me playing video games and/or playing around with Sir Charles, my cat 🐈.
